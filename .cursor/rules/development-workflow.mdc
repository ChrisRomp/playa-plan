# Development Workflow

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` at the root
3. Start development:
   - For frontend only: `cd apps/web && npm run dev`
   - For backend only: `cd apps/api && npm run dev`
   - For both: `npm run dev`

## Development Guidelines

- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) when implementing new features
- Use SOLID principles
- Methods should do one thing only
- Maximum method length: 20 lines where practical
- Descriptive naming:
  - Methods: verb + noun (e.g., validateCredentials)
  - Classes: noun (e.g., CredentialValidator)
  - Tests: should + behavior (e.g., shouldValidateCredentials)
- No abbreviations unless universally known
- Keep nesting level <= 2 where practical
- Sign all git commits; do not bypass signature if there's an error signing

## Testing

Tests are located alongside the code they test:
- Web: [apps/web/tests/](mdc:apps/web/tests)
- API: [apps/api/test/](mdc:apps/api/test)

Run tests with:
- All tests: `npm test` at the root
- Web tests: `npm test` in the web directory
- API tests: `npm test` in the api directory

## Code Quality

Code quality is enforced with:
- [.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc) - Code formatting
- [eslint.config.cjs](mdc:eslint.config.cjs) - Linting
- [.editorconfig](mdc:.editorconfig) - Editor consistency

Format code with: `npm run format`
Lint code with: `npm run lint`
