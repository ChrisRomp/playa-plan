# Development Workflow

This guide outlines the development workflow used in the PlayaPlan project.

## Task Management

- Frontend tasks are tracked in [Web-tasks.md](mdc:../../Web-tasks.md)
- Backend tasks are tracked in [API-tasks.md](mdc:../../API-tasks.md)
- Tests should pass before items are checked off
- Tasks should be checked off as they are completed
- Commit changes to git after each completed task

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. Write tests first before implementing functionality
2. Run tests to verify they fail for the expected reasons
3. Implement the minimum code needed to pass the tests
4. Refactor while ensuring tests continue to pass
5. Commit working code with passing tests

## Code Style and Quality

- Follow [SOLID principles](mdc:https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- Methods should follow single responsibility principle
- Maximum method length: 20 lines where practical
- Keep nesting level <= 2 where practical
- No abbreviations unless universally known

## Naming Conventions

- **Methods**: verb + noun (e.g., validateCredentials)
- **Classes**: noun (e.g., CredentialValidator)
- **Tests**: should + behavior (e.g., shouldValidateCredentials)
- Use descriptive naming that clearly communicates purpose

## Git Workflow

- Work on feature branches
- Keep commits focused on single tasks/changes
- Write clear commit messages
- Open pull requests for code review

## Running the Application

### Backend (NestJS)

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run start:dev  # Start in development mode
npm run test       # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e   # Run e2e tests
npm run prisma:dev # Apply Prisma schema changes
```

### Frontend (React)

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run test       # Run unit tests
npm run build      # Build for production
```

## Database Management

- Use Prisma Studio to view/edit database contents: `npx prisma studio`
- Apply migrations with `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Reset test database with `npx prisma migrate reset --force`
