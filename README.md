# PlayaPlan

This project is still a work in progress. I'm hoping to have it ready in time for my old camp to use in mid-May, 2025. If you're interested in using it for another camp, feel free to reach out (open an issue).

## Requirements

- Node.js version 22 or higher
- PostgreSQL database

## Development Setup

See [Copilot Setup Documentation](./docs/copilot-setup.md) for details on setting up the development environment.

More updates here once it's ready for testing.
